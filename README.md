# Maxwell Smart

**NOTE: this is not ready since it assumes the latest version of the
Google Closure Library which is not used by ClojureScript**.

## Installing

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/maxwell/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/om-routes)

    (:require [maxwell.smart :as smart])

## Description

I needed to log exceptions in running ClojureScript clients to the
backend. Maxwell extracts all possible information out of the client,
serializes the error, and sends it over the wire.
